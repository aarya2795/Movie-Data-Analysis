# What is Data Analysis?
Data analysis is a process for obtaining raw data and converting it into
information useful for decision-making by users.<br>
Wikipedia defines it as the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation,
presentation, and organization of data.
<br>
# Need of Statistics for Data Analysis
Statistics is a broad field with applications in many industries.<br>
Data analysis requires descriptive statistics and probability theory, at a
minimum. These concepts will help you make better business decisions from
data.
<br>
# What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial component of data science which
allows you to develop the gist of what your data look like and what kinds of
questions might be answered by them.
<br>
# 3 main points of EDA
<ol type="1">
<li> Cleansing </li>
<li> Defining the right questions </li>
<li> Using effective visualisations </li>
</ol>
<br>
# Important python packages
<ol type="1">
<li> Numpy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. </li>
<li> Pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. </li>
<li> Matplotlib: A Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hard copy formats and interactive environments across platforms.</li>
<li> Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.</li>
</ol>

# Step1: Data Cleansing
<b>Data cleansing</b> is the first and a very crucial step in the overall <b>data</b> preparation process and is the process of analysing, identifying and correcting messy, raw <b>data</b>. When analysing organisational <b>data to make strategic decisions you must start with a thorough <b>data cleansing</b> process.
<br>
# Step 2: Identifying relationships between variables / features
The main goal here is to identify and create relationships which can help you to
build a hypothesis. Weâ€™ll have to define questions which can help us build some
relationships to look at.
<br>
# Step 3: Data Visualizations
